            In 2018, my friend (Benson Onu) traveled from New Jersey to Lagos Nigeria six times a year to inspect a
            property
            under construction. That was a lot of flight hours, and cost for something a remote assistant could do in
            minutes
            via live video transmission.

            I booked a beautiful Airbnb apartment in Accra in August 2023. On arrival, I disliked the apartment due to
            its
            neighborhood. And I said to myself, a virtual live video tour of the neighborhood would have saved me the
            hassle of
            booking an apartment in a neighborhood I am uncomfortable with.

            For these reasons, we approached solutions to these challenges from a technical standpoint with the
            understanding
            that we can contribute to a better tourism experience, business engagements, and make relationships better
            by
            providing interactive on-demand live video coverage to build users' confidence at all levels.
